You can easily redirect ESS users (who do not have a role) to an employee self-service page by adding the property glide.entry.loggedin.page_ess to the System Properties table.
Set the value of this property to the full URL with the ESS page, such as: instance.service-now.com/myesspages. This is a global property, and it applies to all IdPs. You cannot set multiple values for different IdPs.

If the user has no role, they are redirected to that URL. If the user has a role, they are redirected to instance.service-now.com/navpage.do.
